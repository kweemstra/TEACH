Created by Cornelis Weemstra

## When and where

- **Date:** 29 March 2019
- **Time:** 09:00hr

## Geting ready

This will be an active learning assignment, which will make use of the python programming language in combination with [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), which you should install (or already have) on your laptops that you bring to the course.

We have prepared some instructions for setting up your environment so that you come prepared and so that we donâ€™t spend precious time on these preparations during the assignment. Please follow the instructions. These instructions should work on Linux, macOS, and Windows.



---
**Step 1:**

If you do not already have Anaconda or Miniconda installed on your machine (Hint: If you are unsure, go ahead and install a fresh copy), follow this link to download Miniconda and install the right package for your OS (Windows, Linux, or MacOS): 

https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

We recommend the 64-bit Python 3.7 version regardless of your OS. Installation should be straightforward (choose default install location), but will inlude agreeing to the license terms (mark/type 'yes').



---
**Step 2:**

Regardless whether you just installed Miniconda or are using an already existing conda environment, create a new environment by typing the following command in you terminal ('Anaconda Prompt' on Windows):

```shell
conda create -n teach -c conda-forge -y python=3.7
```

And activate this new environment with:

```shell
conda activate teach
```

---
**Step 3:**

Now install the packages needed to run the course notebooks with the following command:

```shell
conda config --add channels conda-forge && conda install -y ipython \
    tornado=5.1.1 jupyter notebook ipywidgets numpy scipy numba pandas \
    gdal netcdf4 matplotlib basemap basemap-data-hires pillow obspy
```
This may take a couple of minutes and will result is many other packages getting installed as conda takes care of package dependencies for you.

---
**Step 4:**

Test your environment:

You should now be good-to-go. To verify this, please type jupyter-notebook in the Terminal. A browser window should open and you should be able to start a new Python 3 Notebook:

If you got stuck somewhere in the process above, I will either let you look over the shoulder of a colleague tomorrow or we will do some quick troubleshooting.

*See you this Thursday,*
