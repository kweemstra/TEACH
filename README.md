# Active learning session created for the UTQ module TEACH
Created by Cornelis Weemstra

## When and where

- **Date:** 29 March 2019
- **Time:** 09:00hr

## Getting ready

This will be an active learning assignment, which will make use of the python programming language in combination with [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), which you should install (or already have) on the laptop that you bring to the course.

I have prepared some instructions for setting up your environment so that you come prepared and so that we donâ€™t spend precious time on these preparations during the assignment. Please follow the instructions. These instructions should work on Linux, macOS, and Windows.



---
**Step 1:**

If you do not already have Anaconda or Miniconda installed on your machine (Hint: If you are unsure, go ahead and install a fresh copy), follow this link to download Miniconda and install the right package for your OS (Windows, Linux, or MacOS): 

https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

Irrespective of your OS, I recommend the 64-bit Python 3.7 version. Installation should be straightforward (choose default install location), but will inlude agreeing to the license terms (mark/type 'yes').



---
**Step 2:**

Regardless whether you just installed Miniconda or are using an already existing conda environment, create a new environment by typing the following command in you terminal ('Anaconda Prompt' on Windows):

```shell
conda create -n teach -c conda-forge -y python=3.7
```

And activate this new environment with:

```shell
conda activate teach
```


---
**Step 3:**

Now install the packages needed to run the course notebooks with the following command:

```shell
conda config --add channels conda-forge && conda install -y ipython \
    tornado=5.1.1 jupyter notebook ipywidgets numpy scipy numba pandas \
    gdal netcdf4 matplotlib basemap basemap-data-hires pillow obspy
```
This may take a couple of minutes and will result in many other packages being installed as conda takes care of the dependencies for you.



---
**Step 4:**

Test your environment:

You should now be good-to-go. To verify this, please type jupyter-notebook in the Terminal. A browser window should open and you should be able to start a new Python 3 Notebook:

If you were able to start a new Python 3 Notebook, you are indeed good-to-go for this Thursday. In case you got stuck somewhere in the process above, I will either let you look over the shoulder of a colleague tomorrow or we will do some quick troubleshooting.
